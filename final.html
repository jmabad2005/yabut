I got my head out the sunroof<br>
I'm blasting our favorite tunes<br>
I only got one thing on my mind<br>
You got me stuck on the thought of you<br>
You're making me feel brand new<br>
You're more than the sunshine in my eyes<br>
You got those pretty eyes in your head, you know it<br>
You got me dancing in my bed so let me show it<br>
You are exactly what I want, kinda cool and kinda not<br>
Wanna give myself to you<br>
Yeah, we're driving down the freeway at night<br>
I only got one thing in the back of my mind (you got me stuck on the thought of you)<br>
I'm feeling like this might be my time to shine<br>
With you, with you, with you<br>
I got my head out the sunroof<br>

Babe, you're too controlling<br>
I'ma feed you to the wolves when you get nasty back at me<br>
But baby, don't distract me<br>
I'm a goner, I lost her<br>
Like, why the hell you wanna play me that way?<br>
You're bad, babe, you double-faced entendre<br>
Life goes on, and on, and on, and on, and on, and<br>
On, and on, and on<br>
On, and on, and on, and on, and on, and<br>

I'm a lover, not a fighter, but I'll light this place on fire<br>
I want it, I'm on it, but babe, at least, I'm honest<br>
I get tired of explaining<br>
As these seasons keep on changing<br>
Life goes on, and on, and on, and on, and on, and<br>
On, and on, and on (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)<br>
On, and on, and on, and on, and on, and<br>
